# Weather Labeling Web Application

This software allows to identify different sensitive weather event in the Mediterranean Sea; in fact you will be able to locate a storm with a specific polygon. This polygon will have its own pop-up where insert a specific weather label on leaflet map. 
The user can watch different parameters :
A) cloud,
B) temperature at 2m,
C) rain,
D) snow,
e) wind.
